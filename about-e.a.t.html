                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to use your lights efficiently. LED lights typically use 75% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs. E.A.T tracks total usage time and energy consumption. Average consumption: 5-15W per LED bulb. Maintenance: Replace LED bulbs every 15,000-25,000 hours of operation (approximately 10-15 years of normal use).</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If a light is not working, first check if it's properly connected to power. Try toggling the switch or replacing the bulb. For flickering lights, ensure the bulb is securely screwed in. If connected smart lights are not appearing in E.A.T, try restarting the device, checking your Wi-Fi connection, or removing and re-adding the device in the app.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to optimise your A/C usage. Air conditioners are among the highest energy consumers in most buildings. E.A.T monitors total runtime hours and energy consumption. Average consumption: 1000-3500W while running. Maintenance: Clean or replace filters every 1-3 months, professional service check recommended annually.</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If your A/C isn't cooling properly, check and clean the filters first. Ensure vents aren't blocked by furniture or curtains. If the unit freezes up, turn it off, allow it to thaw completely, and check filters. For unusual noises, schedule a professional inspection. If your A/C isn't connecting to E.A.T, check that your smart thermostat has a stable Wi-Fi connection and try resetting the connection in the app settings.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to manage your speaker's energy use. While speakers consume relatively little power, standby power can add up over time. E.A.T provides data on active and standby power consumption. Average consumption: 5-50W depending on volume and model. Maintenance: Check cables for wear annually, clean dust from speaker grills every 6 months.</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> For no sound output, check all cable connections and ensure the correct input source is selected. If sound is distorted, reduce the volume and check for interference from nearby electronics. For wireless speakers, reset the Bluetooth connection and ensure the device is properly charged. If the speaker isn't appearing in E.A.T, try turning it off completely (not just standby) and then back on before reconnecting.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to optimise projector energy use. Modern projectors vary greatly in energy consumption based on brightness settings. E.A.T tracks operating hours and power usage. Average consumption: 150-300W during operation. Maintenance: Replace lamp every 1,500-5,000 hours depending on model, clean air filters every 100 hours of use.</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If the projector won't turn on, check power connections and ensure the lamp door is properly closed. For dim display, the lamp may need replacement. If overheating occurs (indicated by shutdown or warning lights), clean air filters and ensure proper ventilation. For connectivity issues with E.A.T, check network settings on the projector and try reconnecting through the app's device setup process.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to maximise battery life and reduce charging frequency. E.A.T tracks power consumption during different usage scenarios. Average consumption: 30-200W during charging and use, depending on workload and model. Maintenance: Clean cooling vents every 3-6 months, battery replacement typically needed every 2-4 years of regular use.</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If your laptop won't charge, try a different power outlet and check the charging cable for damage. For overheating issues, clean cooling vents and use on hard surfaces rather than soft bedding. If battery drains too quickly, check for resource-intensive background processes and adjust power settings. For laptops not showing up in E.A.T, ensure the E.A.T software is installed correctly and has proper permissions to access power management data.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to reduce printer energy waste. Printers often consume significant power in standby mode. E.A.T measures both active and standby power usage. Average consumption: 5-10W on standby, 300-500W while printing. Maintenance: Print head cleaning every 1-2 months, replace ink/toner when indicated, professional service recommended annually for high-volume printers.</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> For paper jams, carefully remove stuck paper following manufacturer instructions. If print quality is poor, run the printer's cleaning cycle and check ink/toner levels. For connectivity issues, restart both the printer and Wi-Fi router, then reconnect. If the printer shows offline in E.A.T, verify it's connected to the network and not in sleep mode, then try removing and re-adding the device in the app settings.</p>

                    <p class="about-text">Learn how to optimise your coffee routine. Coffee machines with heating elements can be energy-intensive. E.A.T records energy use during brewing and warming cycles. Average consumption: 800-1500W while brewing, 50-200W to keep warm. Maintenance: Descale every 1-3 months depending on water hardness, replace filters as recommended by manufacturer (typically every 1-2 months).</p>
                    
                    <p class="troubleshooting-text"><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If coffee tastes bitter or machine is slow, run a descaling cycle. For leaks, check water reservoir placement and seal condition. If the machine won't turn on, check the power connection and any reset buttons. For smart coffee machines not connecting to E.A.T, restart both the coffee machine and your Wi-Fi router, then try reconnecting through the app's guided setup process.</p>
